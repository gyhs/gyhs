# Hi there, I'm NIKA

I'm a Computer Science, Data Science and video game modding enthusiast and a tinkerer at heart. I am currently a BSc student at AGH UST in Kraków. Feel free to take a look around my various repositories and projects :)

Aside from my own projects, I have contributed or took a leading role in several open source projects. The most notable include:

* [PyCaret, an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret)
