# Hi there, I'm Antoni ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science, Data Science and video game modding enthusiast and a tinkerer at heart. I am currently a BSc student at AGH UST in KrakÃ³w. Feel free to take a look around my various repositories and projects :)

Aside from my own projects, I have contributed or took a leading role in several open source projects. The most notable include:

* [PyCaret, an open source, low-code machine learning library in Python](https://github.com/pycaret/pycaret)
* [Equestria at War, a Hearts of Iron IV modification](https://github.com/EaW-Team/equestria_dev)
* [cwtools, a library for parsing, editing, and validating Paradox Interactive script files](https://github.com/cwtools/)
* [tune-sklearn, a scikit-learn API on RayTune](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn)
